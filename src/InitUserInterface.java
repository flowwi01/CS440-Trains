	 * This class will be used to create the initial jWindows and what not so users can put in info. 
	 * This class will also contain methods to create sensor objects, track objects, number of 
	 * trains with their location and direction. 
	 * 
	 * Jury is still out on weather or not i will include the Node map visualizer for the train tracks 
	 * in this class. It may make more sense to handle the run time graphics in a new class. However having everything visual in the user interface class will make for an easier time.
